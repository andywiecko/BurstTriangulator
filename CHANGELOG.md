# Change log

## [1.4.0] - 2022-11-01

### Features

- Added option for transforming input positions (as well as holes) into normalized local space, i.e. [-1, 1] box. Converting points into normalized local space could increase numerical accuracy.

### Fixes

- Fix deferred array support in triangulator input.
- Add missing constraint position range validation.
- Fix whitespaces in code and `README.md`.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-04-09

### Features

- Restoring input boundaries. The feature allows for restoring a given boundary from triangulation input.
It is necessary to provide constraints, as well as enable corresponding
options in the triangulation settings, aka `RestoreBoundary`.
- Support for holes in the mesh.
- Upload project's logo generated using the above features. 

### Changes

- More verbose warnings during input validation.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-04-02

### Features

- Add support for the Constraint Delaunay Triangulation with mesh refinement.

### Changes

- Performance: Bower-Watson point insertion algorithm has been optimised and is based on the breadth-first search.
- Refactor: moved a few methods from jobs into `TriangulatorNativeData`.
- Refactor: structures have more compact layout. 

## [1.1.0] - 2022-03-27

### Features

- Add support for Constraint Delaunay Triangulation. Selected edges can be constrained e.g. for restoring the boundary. The feature currently does not support mesh refinement. 
- Basic validation of the input positions as well as input constraint edges.

### Changes

- Refactor of input/output data buffers, some of them are marked as obsoletes. 

## [1.0.1] - 2021-11-24

### Changed

- Util function `GetCircumcenter` has been optimized. It is faster and more stable.
- Unity packages have been updated (Note: there was API changed in `FixedList<T>`).

## [1.0.0] ⁠– 2021-10-26

### Features

- Initial release version
