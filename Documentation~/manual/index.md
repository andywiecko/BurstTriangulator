A single-file package which provides Delaunay triangulation of the given set of points with constraints and mesh refinement.

To showcase the functionality of our package, we provide an illustrative example featuring the triangulation of Lake Superior using different refinement parameters. The top-left image displays the initial result without any refinement applied.
