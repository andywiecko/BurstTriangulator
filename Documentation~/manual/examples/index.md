# Example usage

Below is an example usage of the [`Triangulator`][triangulator] with an input set consisting of four points that form the unit square:

```csharp
using var positions = new NativeArray<double2>(new double2[]
{
  new(0, 0), new(1, 0), new(1, 1), new(0, 1),
}, Allocator.Persistent);
using var triangulator = new Triangulator(capacity: 1024, Allocator.Persistent)
{
  Input = { Positions = positions }
};

triangulator.Run();

var triangles = triangulator.Output.Triangles;
```

> [!TIP]  
> The [`triangulator.Run()`][run] method runs on the main thread.
> If you want to call this within a jobs pipeline, schedule a job using [`triangulator.Schedule(dependencies)`][schedule].
> Click [**here**](xref:example-unity-jobs) to learn how to use triangulation within a jobs pipeline.

If triangulation fails for some reason, you can catch the information using [`Status`][status]

```csharp
status = triangulator.Output.Status.Value;
if (status == Triangulator.Status.ERR) // ERROR!
{
  return;
}
```

The result of the triangulation procedure will depend on the selected settings.
There are a few settings for triangulation, which are briefly described in the [API documentation][settings].
Follow the articles in the manual to learn more about settings.
In other examples, the following *cool* guitar was used as an input test case:
