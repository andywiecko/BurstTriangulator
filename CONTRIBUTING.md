# Contributing

- **Use [conventional commits].** Example: `feat: add login feature`.
- **Add unit tests.** Ensure all new features and bug fixes are covered by unit tests. Run existing tests before submitting your PR.
- **Write documentation.** Update the `Documentation~/` directory with relevant information about your changes.
- **Small Pull Requests.** Submit a few small PRs instead of a single large one. This makes reviewing faster and more manageable.
- **Minimalism and simplicity.** Prioritize minimalistic, simple, and user-friendly solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity in project namespace.
