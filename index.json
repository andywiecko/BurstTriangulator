Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible. Using Creative Commons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors. Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 – Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope. a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 – License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses. Creative Commons may be contacted at creativecommons.org"

    "keywords": "Change log All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning. For online version see Github Releases. 3.2.1 – 2024-09-03 Changed Significant updates to the API documentation. (Internal) Miscellaneous changes. Deprecated The OutputData(Triangulator<T2>) constructor is now obsolete. It will be made internal in future versions. Fixed Resolved a potential issue causing an infinite loop during the PlantingSeedStep with AutoHolesAndBoundary. 3.2.0 – 2024-08-28 Added Support for additional types: Vector2, int2, and fp2 (fixed-point in Q31.32 format). Note: fp2 requires an optional dependency. Refer to the manual for more details. (Internal) Introduced TrianglesComparer to simplify triangle assertions in tests. Args is now blittable and can be used in Burst-compiled static methods. Enhanced validation logs to include position information. Changed (Internal) Various simplifications, minor performance improvements, refactoring, and additional code comments. Deprecated AsNativeArray() and ManagedInput have been deprecated for safety reasons. Use AsNativeArray(out Handle handle) instead. Refer to the manual for more information. Fixed Corrected the refinement of concentric shells segment splitting factor alpha. Fixed safety issues with AsNativeArray. Fully collinear input is now handled correctly. 3.1.0 – 2024-08-01 Added Native support with a low-level API for triangulation via UnsafeTriangulator<T>. This allows for customization of steps and calling triangulation directly from jobs. Extensions for UnsafeTriangulator<T>: Triangulate, PlantHoleSeeds, and RefineMesh. Support for managed input. Public ConstrainedHalfedges in triangulation output. Fixed Edge-edge intersection for collinear non-intersecting edges (issue #173). 3.0.0 – 2024-06-30 Added New online documentation (including manual and scripting API): https://andywiecko.github.io/BurstTriangulator/ Verbose option in triangulation settings. Halfedges for triangulation output. AutoHolesAndBoundary option in triangulation settings. This option allows for automatic hole detection, eliminating the need for the user to provide hole positions. Holes are calculated using constraint edges. Support for generic coordinates. Users can specify the type of coordinates used in the triangulation with Triangulator<T2>. The API for this class is the same as Triangulator, except the input/output is of type T2. Supported coordinate types: float2, double2 (int2 will be implemented in the future). Changed Increased performance for constrainedHalfedges generation. Circle based calculations now use RadiusSq instead of Radius. This results in increased performance in the refinement step, however, the final results may be slightly different. Breaking change: Moved most of the inner types (e.g., Status, TriangulatorSettings, etc.) to the global namespace. They can now be accessed directly using using andywiecko.BurstTriangulator;. Breaking change: The default coordinate type for Triangulator is now double2 instead of float2. (Internal) Greatly simplified job logic replaced with steps. Overall triangulation logic is now easier to follow and read. Some internal structs were removed or hidden inside steps. Removed Obsolete settings: BatchCount, MinimumAngle, MinimumArea, MaximumArea, and ConstrainEdges. Fixed Run triangulator on the main thread using the Run() method. 2.5.0 – 2024-04-03 Changed Simplified PlantingSeedJob by removing generics and introducing an algorithm based on constraintEdges. This resulted in improved performance. Changed the triangulator to schedule a single job instead of multiple smaller ones. Greatly simplified the preprocessor transformations code. All transformations are now represented by the AffineTransform2D struct, and several jobs have been removed. Deprecated Deprecated the Triangulator.Settings.ConstrainEdges property. To enable constrained edges, pass the corresponding array into input. Deprecated the Triangulator.Settings.BatchCount property. This property is no longer used, setting it has no effect. Fixed Fixed constructing pointToHalfedges during constraint resolution. This resolves GitHub issue #111. 2.4.0 – 2023-12-23 Added Introduce ConcentricShellParameter in TriangulationSettings, serving as a constant for concentric shells segment splitting. Add RefinementThresholds in TriangulationSettings, including .Area and .Angle. Previous corresponding parameters are marked with obsolete. Changed Enhance triangulation refinement for improved quality and performance. Replace the previous algorithm with a new one, similar to Shewchuk's terminator algorithm. The refined mesh now exhibits non-uniform triangle density, with increased density near boundaries and decreased density in the mesh bulk. Update README.md to include a comparison between different refinement settings. Remove the super-triangle approach (resulting in a slight performance boost). Perform refinement after removing holes and boundaries for better refinement quality. Deprecated Mark MinimumArea, MaximumArea, and MinimumAngle as obsolete. Replace these parameters with the more versatile RefinementThresholds. 2.3.0 – 2023-10-25 Changed Improved performance by adapting triangulation with mesh refinement to a half-edges approach. Simplified the refinement job contract. Merged several internal jobs for better efficiency. General project simplification for enhanced maintainability. Removed Eliminated edgeToTriangles and triangleToEdges mappings. Removed the internal Triangle struct. 2.2.0 ⁠– 2023-10-03 Changed Simplified constrained triangulation scheduling jobs pipeline. Adapted constrained triangulation for half-edges approach, which significantly improved performance. The algorithm no longer relies on triangulation mappings, such as edge-to-triangle and triangle-to-edge relationships (or circles). The complexity of the intersection searching algorithm has been reduced from a naive O(n^2) solution to O(n log n). Fixed Resolved Sloan algorithm corner cases. In previous releases, constrained triangulation may get stuck. Constrained triangulation is now more robust. Added Added constrained triangulation benchmark test. The results may be found at README.md. 2.1.0 ⁠– 2023-09-17 Changed Replaced the classic Delaunay algorithm (without refinement/constraints) with an implementation based on half-edges (see delaunator and delaunator-sharp for more details). This change has led to a significant performance boost in unconstrained triangulation. See README.md for more details. Refactored some internal math utilities. 2.0.0 ⁠– 2023-09-09 Added Introduced the Preprocessor enum with the following options: None, COM, and PCA. This enum replaces the previous transformation settings (UseLocalTransformation/UsePCATransformation). Introduced the Status (with values OK, ERR) enum along with corresponding native data. This enum is now utilized for input validation, with functionality extending beyond the Unity editor to encompass validation in builds as well. Added a benchmark test for mesh refinement, which will be used for future performance measurement. Changed Default values for TriangulationSettings. Updated Unity Editor to version 2022.2.1f1. Bumped dependencies: Burst to 1.8.7, Collections to 2.2.0. Removed Removed the following deprecated methods: Schedule(NativeArray<float2>, ...). Removed the following deprecated properties: Positions, Triangles, PositionsDeferred, PositionsDeferred. Removed the internal TriangulatorNativeData as part of a significant refactor to simplify the code structure. Internal implementations were cleaned up, and code structure was simplified. 1.5.0 ⁠– 2023-04-12 Added Added PCA transformation for input positions and holes. Fixed Editor hangs during Sloan algorithm for specific input data (issues #30 and #31). 1.4.0 ⁠– 2022-11-01 Added Added option for transforming input positions (as well as holes) into normalized local space, i.e. [-1, 1] box. Converting points into normalized local space could increase numerical accuracy. Fixed Fix deferred array support in triangulator input. Add missing constraint position range validation. Fix whitespaces in code and README.md. 1.3.0 ⁠– 2022-04-09 Added Restoring input boundaries. The feature allows for restoring a given boundary from triangulation input. It is necessary to provide constraints, as well as enable corresponding options in the triangulation settings, aka RestoreBoundary. Support for holes in the mesh. Upload project's logo generated using the above features. Changed More verbose warnings during input validation. 1.2.0 ⁠– 2022-04-02 Added Add support for the Constraint Delaunay Triangulation with mesh refinement. Changed Performance: Bower-Watson point insertion algorithm has been optimised and is based on the breadth-first search. Refactor: moved a few methods from jobs into TriangulatorNativeData. Refactor: structures have more compact layout. 1.1.0 ⁠– 2022-03-27 Added Add support for Constraint Delaunay Triangulation. Selected edges can be constrained e.g. for restoring the boundary. The feature currently does not support mesh refinement. Basic validation of the input positions as well as input constraint edges. Deprecated Refactor of input/output data buffers, some of them are marked as obsoletes. 1.0.1 ⁠– 2021-11-24 Changed Util function GetCircumcenter has been optimized. It is faster and more stable. Unity packages have been updated (Note: there was API changed in FixedList<T>). 1.0.0 ⁠– 2021-10-26 Added Initial release version"

To use this, similar to Unity.Collections, you need to load the low-level namespace: using andywiecko.BurstTriangulator.LowLevel.Unsafe; UnsafeTriangulator<T2> is an empty readonly struct which provide API which can be used directly in native context in the jobs pipeline. Additionally this struct allows much more customization with respect to managed Triangulator<T2>, however, the user is responsible to data allocation, including output data. Below one can find minimal working example using UnsafeTriangulator<T2> using var positions = new NativeArray<float2>(..., Allocator.Temp); using var triangles = new NativeArray<int>(64, Allocator.Temp); new UnsafeTriangulator<float2>().Triangulate( input: new() { Positions = positions }, output: new() { Triangles = triangles }, args: Args.Default(), allocator: Allocator.Persistent ); this corresponds to the following managed approach with Triangulator<T2> using var triangulator = new Triangulator(Allocator.Persistent) { Input = { Positions = new float2[]{ ... }.AsNativeArray() } }; triangulator.Run(); var triangles = triangulator.Output.Triangles; Learn more in the Parameters section about how to set up the triangulation and the Extensions section to learn about other customization steps for triangulation. Parameters All extension methods related to UnsafeTriangulator<T2> API except standard additional parameters, include custom struct parameters: LowLevel.Unsafe.InputData<T2>, LowLevel.Unsafe.OutputData<T2>, LowLevel.Unsafe.Args. The first two structs are the same as managed types InputData<T2> and OutputData<T2>, respectively. They have the same fields/properties. Similar situation is with LowLevel.Unsafe.Args and managed corresponding TriangulationSettings, however the first, one is readonly struct and cannot be easily modified. Due to current C# lang version restriction used in Unity structs cannot have default values for field and properties. To create Args manually use Args.Default() method and pass parameter which you want to change from default value, e.g. var args = Args.Default(refineMesh: true); To \"modify\" the LowLevel.Unsafe.Args, one can use the With method. This method returns new args with the selected parameters replaced. For example: var args = Args.Default(); args = args.With(refineMesh: true); LowLevel.Unsafe.Args can be implicitly converted from TriangulationSettings. So one can store TriangulationSettings as a serialized field in a MonoBehaviour and cast to args if necessary var settings = new TriangulationSettings(); Args args = settings; Extensions Below, you can find extensions (with descriptions and examples) that can be used with UnsafeTriangulator. Check out the unit tests for additional use cases. Triangulate The extension Triangulate(input, output, args, allocator) is the simplest option to use. The action of this extension essentially produces the same result as the Run method for the managed Triangulator. It can be useful when triangulation is done with Allocator.Temp in a single job or to combine this with different extensions. using var positions = new NativeArray<float2>(..., Allocator.Persistent); using var constraints = new NativeArray<int>(..., Allocator.Persistent); using var holesSeeds = new NativeArray<float2>(..., Allocator.Persistent); using var triangles = new NativeList<int>(64, Allocator.Persistent); new UnsafeTriangulator<float2>().Triangulate( input: new() { Positions = positions, ConstraintEdges = constraints, HoleSeeds = holesSeeds }, output: new() { Triangles = triangles }, args: Args.Default(refineMesh: true, restoreBoundary: true), allocator: Allocator.Persistent ); PlantHoleSeeds The extension PlantHoleSeeds(input, output, args, allocator) is particularly useful when the user requires mesh data without removed triangles and additional mesh copy with removed triangles. In this case, the triangulation is performed once, which is generally a more expensive operation. Below is an example usage with the autoHolesAndBoundary option selected: var input = new LowLevel.Unsafe.InputData<double2> { Positions = ..., ConstraintEdges = ..., }; using var triangles = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Persistent); using var halfedges = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Persistent); using var constrainedHalfedges = new NativeList<bool>(Allocator.Persistent); var output = new LowLevel.Unsafe.OutputData<double2> { Triangles = triangles, Halfedges = halfedges, ConstrainedHalfedges = constrainedHalfedges, }; var args = Args.Default(); var t = new UnsafeTriangulator<double2>(); t.Triangulate(input, output, args), Allocator.Persistent); t.PlantHoleSeeds(input, output, args.With(autoHolesAndBoundary: true), Allocator.Persistent); Note Depending on the options, some of the buffers may not be required for PlantHoleSeeds. For example, when the user provides HoleSeeds in InputData<T2>, Positions in OutputData<T2> must be provided. However, in other cases, it may not be required. RefineMesh The extension RefineMesh(output, allocator, areaThreshold?, angleThreshold?, concentricShells?, constrainBoundary?) can be used to refine any triangulation mesh, even an already refined one. Please note that both the managed TriangulationSettings and native Args provide refinement parameter setups only for float precision. This extension allows you to provide these parameters with the selected precision type T in generics. These parameters have the following default values (in the given precision type T, if this extension is available for T): areaThreshold = 1; angleThreshold = math.radians(5) concentricShells = 0.001 The last optional parameter, constrainBoundary, is used to constrain boundary halfedges. Since the refinement algorithm (whether for constrained triangulation or not) requires constrained halfedges at the boundary, not setting this option may cause unexpected behavior, especially when the restoreBoundary option is disabled. Below is an example of refinement in the unsafe context: using var triangles = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Persistent); using var halfedges = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Persistent); using var constrainedHalfedges = new NativeList<bool>(Allocator.Persistent); using var outputPositions = new NativeList<float2>(Allocator.Persistent); var input = new LowLevel.Unsafe.InputData<float2> { Positions = ..., ConstraintEdges = ..., }; var output = new LowLevel.Unsafe.OutputData<float2> { Triangles = triangles, Halfedges = halfedges, Positions = outputPositions, ConstrainedHalfedges = constrainedHalfedges }; var t = new UnsafeTriangulator<float2>(); t.Triangulate(input, output, Args.Default(restoreBoundary: true), Allocator.Persistent); t.RefineMesh(output, Allocator.Persistent, areaThreshold: 1, angleThreshold: 0.5f, constrainBoundary: false);"

    "title": "Introduction | BurstTriangulator",
    "keywords": "Introduction Delaunay triangulation Triangulation is a process that converts a set of points into a triangles mesh. This package implements Delaunay triangulation, ensuring that every triangle's circumcircle contains no points from within the mesh. It's important to note that the result will be the convex hull of the input points. Given a set of positions \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) as input, the output is the triangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Constrained triangulation In addition to basic triangulation, users may want to enforce certain edges in the final mesh. This can be achieved by providing additional input specifying edge vertices. However, it's worth noting that the resulting triangulation may not maintain the Delaunay property. The input for constrained triangulation includes a set of positions \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) and constraint edges \\(\\{(i, j)\\}\\), with the output being the triangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Mesh refinement In computational simulations, accurately representing long, thin triangles is often challenging. To address this issue, additional points can be strategically inserted into the triangulation to eliminate these problematic elements. Since simulation time is typically proportional to the number of triangles, it's crucial to strike a balance: minimizing the number of triangles while maintaining sufficient detail for accurate results. In this process, denoted as mesh refinement, the input triangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is transformed into \\(\\mathcal{T'}\\) by inserting additional points to split edges or triangles. Restore boundary As previously mentioned, Delaunay triangulation produces the convex hull of points. To support non-convex shapes, edge constraints are introduced, and triangles not included in the boundary of the constraints are removed. Given a set of positions \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) and constraints \\(\\{(i, j)\\}\\) as input, the output is the triangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), ensuring that the resulting mesh adheres to the specified boundary constraints. Holes Triangulation can be extended to support meshes with holes by using additional input data, such as hole seeds \\(\\{h_i\\}\\). However, this process can be automated in some cases, so the holes do not need to be present in the input data. Hole seeds act as starting points for a removal process resembling the spread of a virus. Starting from the triangle containing \\(h_i\\), neighboring triangles are successively removed until the search reaches the constraint edge. In this process, constraint edges act as barriers, preventing further propagation of the removal. Implementation In this package implemented classic Delaunay triangulation is based on delaunator and delaunator-sharp. Refinement algorithm is based on Ruppert's algorithm1 with Bowyer–Watson algorithm2 3 point insertion. Refinement procedure is inspired by Shewchuk's terminator algorithm4. The package provides also constrained triangulation (with mesh refinement) which is based on Sloan's algorithm5. Throughout these algorithms, the package utilizes the half-edges data structure.
